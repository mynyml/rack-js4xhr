===== Summary

As it is highly common to want to return javascript from an ajax request, this
rack middleware will set the application/javascript media type on xhr requests.

If the 'X-Requested-With' header is present, 'application/javascript' will be
prepended to the Accept header, available as env['HTTP_ACCEPT'].
